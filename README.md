# DOOM clone

My attempt to recreate DOOM.

Game data is loaded from the original WAD files
(not included in this repo, you can use the shareware version
if you don't have the game).

Follows roughly the same naming conventions as the released DOOM source
code:
 - `w_`  WAD I/O
 - `p_`  gameplay
 - `r_`  rendering
 - `am_` automap
 - `st_` statusbar
