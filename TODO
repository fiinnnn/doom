- Memory management
    Similar to doom zone system, track allocated blocks of memory and include
    flags when to free. Should eliminate the need to manually free blocks.

- Main game loop
    - Fixed timestep updates
    - Decouple from SDL events

- Palette
    Use 256 color palette. This would completely decouple the framebuffer
    format from the rest of the engine.

- Debug UI
    Immediate mode UI to make debugging easier.
